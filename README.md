# Epidemiological Modelling: Deterministic and Stochastic SIR/SIS Models

This project explores deterministic and stochastic epidemic models, focusing on vaccination, social distancing, outbreak probability, and model extensions to understand disease spread.

## Contents
- **`Epidemic_Models.ipynb`** â€“ Jupyter notebook with code, results, and explanations  
- Markdown cells in the notebook explain methods, results, and key insights

## Key Features
- Deterministic SIR simulations (baseline model)  
- Effects of vaccination and social distancing on outbreaks  
- Stochastic simulations and outbreak probability estimation  
- Comparison between stochastic and deterministic models  
- Extensions: SIS and SEIR frameworks for greater realism
